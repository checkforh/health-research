Personal health plan done with:
- notebooklm 
- gemini deep search
- youtube
And with books:
- Eat to beat disease
- Toxic superfoods
- alkaline herbal medicine
- Good energy
- The longevity nutrient


Supplements I take everyday:
- multi-vitamin: vitamin D is food inadequate and sun doesn't always shine. Vitamin B deficiency can have serious consequences. Minerals (potassium, magnesium, sodium, zinc) are necessary for disposal of oxalates.
- spirulina and chlorella: good all rounder (omega3, antioxidants, detox), cheap, although not ideal assimilation because of cellulose
- fish oil: just for omega3, make sure the brand cares about lasting storage, or buy in small amounts such that you are sure that the contents are fresh and not oxidized
- red rice q10: for cholesterol
- glycine: helps deep sleep, overall safe health boost
- creatine and whey protein: everyday but on high work days an higher dose
- Acetyl-L-Carnitine and taurine: help cognitive functions and neurons
- propolis: benefits of honey without much sugar
- methylene blue: improve metabolism

Supplements I take infrequently:
- beetroot extract: for liver and cardiovascular health. When I take it I take it for 3 days.
- Vitamin B complex: when I eat very little animal based food, to compensate.
- hydrolyzed collagen: skin and joints (I take one with type I,II,III,V,X), since high collagen does can cause high oxalates production, its better to take it only one days with very little animal based food (like vitamin B)
- pre/pro biotics and colostrum: once per week, the day after high carb meal (e.g. pizza) to help microbiome
- NAC: when I have pains or flu of anykind since it has anti-inflammatory effects

- mushroom complex: the body builds tolerance to most compounds found in mushrooms, so its better to take them on and off.
- ashwaganda: best to cycle, since organism can build tolerance
- l-theanine, ashwaganda: for their calming effects, cycle between each other
- nootropic (brain complex): can have a bunch of mushrooms and roots, since its likely that most nootropics cause downregulation, only take it on occasion, on though days, whatever the complex, make sure it doesn't have caffeine and l-theanine (we try to avoid caffeine as much as possible, and l-theanine is on a different schedule).

Detox:
- clay: after food that is hard to digest (like high carbs, meat or fish), usually at midnight such that it is distant from any meal (i don't wake up on purpose, but if i wake up, i take it)
- silymarin (milk thistle): of one month per year, on january or before summer
- ceterach officinarium: 6 months after silymarin, such that you have 2 detox runs per year

Brain:
- Nasal spray of selank/semax: 1 month
- Nasal spray of cortigen: 6 months after selank/semax

Metabolism:
- Sleep is important, to follow circadian rhytms ensure sunlight in the morning, circadian rhytms help metabolism
- short high stress excercise helps metabolism
- Vitamins B1, B2, B6, B7 are important for metabolism
- reduce stress to improve mitochondrial function
- poor gut bacteria affects metabolism, prefer whole foods to processed foods, good bacteria produce short chain fatty acid, diet high in fiber is important for bacteria (prebiotics), fermented foods can reintroduce good bacteria (probiotics)
- poor energy metaboism is at the root of many chronic diseases
- keep your liver healthy as its crucial for good metabolism (low sugar/carbs, low alcohol)
- micronutrients and antioxidants support mitochondrial function
- sufficient protein intake is important for metabolic homeostasis
- avoid Bad Energy Foods: Minimize refined added sugar, refined industrial vegetable and seed oils, and refined grains
- Stabilize Blood Sugar through strategies like preloading meals with vinegar, non-starchy vegetables, fat, protein, and/or fiber before higher carbohydrate foods
- Engage in Regular Movement, which improves mitochondrial health, glucose control, and overall metabolic biomarkers
- Don't eat at least for 2 hours before bed time to avoid high heart rate.
- Many pollutants from outdoor or indoor (cleaning products etc) can affect metabolism, minimize their usage by replacing with non industrial versions
- carbs lower fat burning efficiency, a keto diet optimizes for fat burning, but cycling keto diet every once in a while with a more vegetables focused one
- Metabolic stress can be linked to oxalate overload
- Metabolic syndrome is also linked to oxalate issues
- energy metabolism problems in brain cells can be promoted by oxalate
- Hunger "cocktail": HTP-5, tryptophan, glucomannan, collagen and whey protein.

Gadgets:
- get a good chair for posture if work is sedentary (and use the correct posture)
- get an ergonomic keyboard if typing a lot
- Binaural beets and background sounds can help with focus (check mynoise.net or brain.fm)
- a grounding mat connects the body to the earth magnetic field, put one on your bed to help sleep
- red light lamp (or blanket): helps cell regenation, synergizes with methylene blue
- hydrogen water bottle: helps detox
- set color temperature of any screen to around 2000K-3000K, if not possible set color to "warm" or reduce greens and blues in favor of reds. Wear blue light protective glasses when exposed to artificial led light (which is likely maximized for brightness and not color temperature)
- use a GCM (glucose monitor) to see how much the food (that you really want to eat but that are not healthy) affect your glucose level
- scalar energy stickers and crystals (pseudo science): stickers (to be attached to electronic devices) capture nocive EM fields, crystals capture background radiation (or just look nice) 
- faraday fabric: actually shields against EM radiation, EM insulation is something worth considering depending on living place
- use a derma roller for face skin health
- plasma mole remover for skin, cause surgeries are expensive
- ablator for teeth cleaning (use once every 1-2 months)
- use a enamel repair toothpaste, like biorepair, synodyne (protect and repair) or others (they feel "grainy" if you grind your teeth with the paste on them), they might have different active ingredients to accomplish the same thing

Good to know:
- vitamin D generated from sun is still better, take sun whenever possible, plus sun heals.
- Supplements can spoil or can have contaminants, check for quality whenver possible
- eye sight can be improved through vision therapy (although unlikely to remove the need of glasses entirely)
- cancer cells use glucose and glutamine as energy source
- high fructose consumption is linked to alzheimer
- eat slowly (15m) to allow body to fill full (release satiety hormones)
- saliva is important for digestion, chew well enough
- any food taken in high doses can cause adverse effects which negate its benefits
- too much vitamin C can reduce body ability to dispose of free radicals
- Certain growth hormone secretagogues may boost metabolism through the release of growth hormone
- Peptides can improve insulin sensitivity, which is important for regulating blood sugar and preventing excessive fat storage
- Regular monitoring of iron levels and lifestyle adjustments (diet, exercise, avoiding iron supplements, limiting vitamin C and alcohol) are important for managing iron overload, which can impact metabolic health
- donating blood (2-3 times per year) can have potential positive health effects
- blue light affect cyrcadian rhytms and metabolism, avoid blu lights
- 1g of carbs is 4 calories, 1g of protein is less than 4 calories, 1g of fat is 9 calories
- if you know the moisture content of food and their carbs/protein/fat ratio, you can guess their amount of calories, you don't have to be precise

Food:
- The body has 5 systems to repair itself: angiogenesis (blood vessels), regeneration (stem cells), microbiome, dna protection and repair, immunity
- food that influences all 5 systems: sunflower seeds, walnuts, seafood, squid ink, olive oil (evoo), dark chocolate
- Recommended daily dosage of oxalates is 250mg, whatever you eat either as food or supplements, take this into consideration.
- C15 is an anti-aging fatty acid, mostly found in dairy (with fats)
- good nuts: almonds, walnuts pistachios, brazil nuts
- bad nuts: peanuts, cashews, macadamia nuts, pine nuts
- vegetables to avoid (oxalates): spinach, beets greens, swiss chard, amaranth leaves and grain, rhubarb, potatoes are ok only peeled
- a keto diet targets less than 20 grams of carbs per day (less than 100 calories)
- avoid plastic containers
